Dear Contributors,

When submitting patches please make sure to:

 - write tests covering your changes,
 - verify that your changes turn your tests from failing to passing,
 - update the `CHANGELOG` by adding an entry to the _unreleased_ section, and
 - adjust the documentation in `README` if necessary.
 
Cheers!

Yours,

hikari-cp maintainers
